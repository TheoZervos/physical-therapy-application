# UI
For our project we are using Flutter/Dart and following a 
Model/View/ViewModel (MVVM) approach. MVVM is a UI methodology where
you separate models, views, and viewmodels from one another in an
attempt to have separation of concerns. Please get a basic understanding of
MVVM before editing code in this directory.
