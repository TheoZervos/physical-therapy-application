# Data
All training data should be stored within this folder and sorted appropriately.
If data that falls outside of these labels is introduced, create a new subfolder to
store it in a sorted manner. PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE .gitignore FILE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING:
`data/*`
We do not want to bloat our repo with data, it should be stored locally.

For sorting purposes on your own machine, sort the data in 3 folders:
1. external
2. raw
3. processed
